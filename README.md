project-euler
=============

Programming solutions to problems put on projecteuler.net. Each file corresponds to a given problem on the site.

I am actively working to add problem solutions for Problems 1-7. I also hope to continue solving Problems 17+. The solutions, however, take time, and my academics must come first.

The problem solutions currently within this repository have not been fully optimized. While I intend on fixing each one to be as optimized as possible, I'm of the philosophy that solving new problems is more important than tweaking old solutions. Feel free to make pull requests of optimized solutions--I'm always interested to hear how I can improve!
